# Spotify Music Player with Audio Visualization

https://nismospotify.herokuapp.com

This was my first web development project, it was as a great learning tool, and was a great merger of my passions for coding and music.  The spectrum analsyer is created with a canvas rendering the magnitude of each frequency bin via the web audio API (Fast Fourier Transfrom).  These analysers were pretty common in 80s and 90s HiFi systems, and was also found in the WinAmp players from the early 2000s.

Currently this project is being refactored into React, and now that Spotify allows for whole song playback, my plan is to make it a full fledge music player, and possibly incorporate web gl for rendering 3d.
